This [github repository](https://github.com/mkolczynska/harmonization-toolbox) contains resources for secondary analysis of data from cross-national survey projects, including ex-post survey data harmonization.

In particular, I collected survey metadata in form of data dictionaries or codebooks, from two major cross-national survey projects: the [Eurobarometer](https://www.gesis.org/en/eurobarometer-data-service/home) and the [International Social Survey Programme](http://w.issp.org/menu-top/home/), which are available [here](https://github.com/mkolczynska/harmonization-toolbox/tree/master/survey-metadata).
