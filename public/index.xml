      <description>Availability across projectsAvailability across countriesThe first step towards harmonization is to learn which surveys have the necessary items - in this case about trust in different institutions: the government, national parliament, political parties, justice system, police, army, press, TV, and religious institutions.
This information, for 13 cross-national survey projects listed here, from 1939 national surveys from 39 European countries, is provided in this file:</description>

      <description>The purpose of the project “Causes and Consequences of Political Trust: Polarization and Democratic Utility of Trust in Cross-national Perspective” is to advance the research on political trust by (1) developing a multi-level theoretical model of the causes and consequences of political trust that takes into account both the level of trust in society and its distributional properties, such as polarization, (2) creating a country time series of measures of political trust levels and polarization derived from existing individual-level survey data via Bayesian dynamic latent trait modeling, and (3) applying appropriate causal and multi-level modeling techniques to the newly constructed time series, as well as to the existing cross-national and panel survey data.</description>
