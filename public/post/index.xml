      <description>A new data note, authored by Marta Kołczyńska and Przemek Powałko, published in the journal Political Research Exchange, presents the Political Parties Crosswalk. From the abstract:
The Political Parties Crosswalk (PPC) maps party codes used in questions about party preferences in European cross-national public opinion surveys to Party Facts IDs, which are commonly used identifiers of parties in political science datasets. The PPC, a data linkage tool, supports research that combines data on party support from surveys with characteristics of parties, and in particular, facilitates research that combines data from different survey projects.</description>

      <description>Availability across projectsAvailability across countriesThe first step towards harmonization is to learn which surveys have the necessary items - in this case about trust in different institutions: the government, national parliament, political parties, justice system, police, army, press, TV, and religious institutions.
This information, for 13 cross-national survey projects listed here, from 1939 national surveys from 39 European countries, is provided in this file:</description>
